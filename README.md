# RISC-V OS

This repository contains a simple RISC-V 32-bit operating system, design
to run on [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/). Written in C and assembly, the
operating system requires LLVM and Clang to compile.

This work is a derived work of [nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines](
https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines). Specifically, it
implements the first 14 chapters of the related book, with some local
modifications, including rearchitecting the whole codebase.
